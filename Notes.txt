SDL_event with mouse click will get only Uint16 (unsigned int 16bits, so integer for us)

So first, the lists of points given by Vincent Nozick (list1.list, list2.list and list3.list)
Are given with double.

The Tensor will be calculated with doubles, then will be arounded into integers in aim
To use the Tensor with user mouse clicks.
