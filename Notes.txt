SDL_event with mouse click will get only Uint16 (unsigned int 16bits, so integer for us)

So first, the lists of points given by Vincent Nozick (list1.list, list2.list and list3.list)
Are given with double.

The Tensor for doubles will be calculated with doubles.
Then we will use another Tensor for integers, copying the value and arounder, ceiling or flooring its value.
