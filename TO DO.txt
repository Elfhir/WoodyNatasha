1/ Implement tranfertTo2 and transfertTo3 ; Wherever you click first 
(image1,image2 or image1,image3 or image2,image3(as it is already done for this case))
It do the transfert.

2/ Allowed user to add firstly new points of correspondance, without calculating transfert point. He can switch mode with one key then. It will
be necessary to calculate matrix A and the tensor t only after new points added, only when user wants to start "drawing" with 'l' key as now.

3/ Allowed New points

4/ Option when executing the program : * 	-h for help on terminal - man page ?
									   * 	[image1.png] [image2.png] [image3.png] For the choice of images user want.
									   *	[image1.png] [image2.png] [image3.png] list1.list list2.list list3.list For the choice of img and list.

											see argc and argv for that; I've try it and it's difficult to do it.
											Be carefull of the size of the images : should they be the same size?
